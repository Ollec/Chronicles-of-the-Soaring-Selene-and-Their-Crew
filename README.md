AI-Dungeon world info based on Scum and Villainy

### Notation and help
Generally we are trying to follow Cat<nip> notation
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SCi91qXdAKvHEEmFqTQnEpn1JX02fA6vRd7v2SCdmbs/edit#
  
Maybe use a generator for Worldinfo ids
  https://numbergenerator.org/random-9-digit-number-generator
  
## Testing before commiting:
 1. Before commiting make sure you can import the world info. No "Unable to parse uploaded file"!
 2. Try running a world and see if you can interact with the new area.
