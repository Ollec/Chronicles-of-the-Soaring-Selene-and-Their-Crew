Manuel A. Lazarus was raised in space on the Galileo, a colony transportation ship.
Spending his childhood years and young adulthood as a member of a crew carting colonists from the inner sectors to isolated plants.
Manual soon become disheartened towards the Federation
(FGGA) after seeing colonists abandoned on isolated plants with little support or
abused as slave labor to feed corporate profit. While on board he was quickly fascinated with all that was mechanical.
From a young age, he would get lost in the ship aiding in repairs or tinkering with drones,
concerning his parents with his long disappearances or single-minded focus.

While on ship studied to be part of the engineering guild.
Got kicked out? Has a partial copy of the Engineering Archive,
partial and not updated. (schematics) (Cause for removal from the guild?)
or was it just the ship blowing up that caused him to leave the guild.
( as they are also partial to blame for their poor designs, for lowly colony ships.)


Possible the Galileo was destroyed lost arm while trying to save the ship,
even though it ultimately failed. Crew and family dead. Claims the FGGAs for
poorly supporting or regulating colonists and cheap undercuts for the ships ultimate destruction. 

After his biological arm was removed, used the archives and
his prior knowledge to rig up a useful arm that now aids him in Rigging. 

Very comfortable on a ship and in low gravity. The happiest while deeply enthralled in a project, weird.

WAY SHIELD, KINETICS, attunement, study, consort.
We get a Coach booth.
Sehn is racing against Chose, there are twins, two Silver and blue. Pin and Min. 
Ghost runner wins vs the first person.
Gok:
	KINETICS
	You can push yourself to do one of the following: use the Way to
	throw a table-sized object with dangerous force—propel yourself
	briefly with superhuman speed.
	Dangerous force means fast enough to severely injure a
	normal person. Superhuman speed means fast enough that
	you’re barely more than a blur. Your reach is about the size of
	a large room. Yes, people can count as objects.
	WAY SHIELD
	You can block blaster bolts with the Way (resist with resolve). If you
	resist a blaster attack, you may spend 1 stress to redirect fire and
	make an attack of your own with it.
	Resisting blasters in this way usually reduces the harm to zero.
Sehn broke his ship a little. Man fixes it (4)
